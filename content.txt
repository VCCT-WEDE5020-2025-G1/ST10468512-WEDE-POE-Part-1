About (about.html)
------------------
Page title: "About Friendly Fix"
Intro: "We are a small, customer-first plumbing team serving our local community. Our mission is simple: do great work and treat people fairly."
History:
"Friendly Fix Plumbing began as a one-van operation in a single neighborhood. After helping a few neighbors with late-night leaks and weekend emergencies, word spread that our team showed up on time, explained the work clearly, and cleaned up before leaving. Those early jobs shaped our promise to be friendly, reliable, and fair on every call.

As referrals grew, we added licensed technicians, invested in better diagnostic tools, and expanded our scheduling hours to include same-day service. Today, Friendly Fix serves homes and small businesses across the area while staying true to what got us here: honest pricing, quality workmanship, and respect for your time and home."
Values:
- Respect for your time and home
- Clear communication and honest pricing
- Quality craftsmanship with reliable parts
Service areas: "Downtown, Riverside, North Hills, and surrounding neighborhoods."
