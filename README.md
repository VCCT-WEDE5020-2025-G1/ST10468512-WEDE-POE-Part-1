## Overview
This site focuses on clarity, speed, and usability for customers who need quick access to services and contact options. The codebase favors standards-based technologies for easy hosting and low maintenance.

## Features
- Responsive layout with mobile-first design
- Modern design system (CSS variables for colors, spacing, typography)
- Enhanced header/navigation with mobile menu and keyboard support
- Hero section with clear primary CTAs (Request a Quote, Call Now)
- Service highlights using accessible cards
- Contact page with client-side UX improvements and loading states
- Smooth scrolling and subtle, performance-optimized animations
- Image lazy loading (when using `data-src`)
- Basic performance logging scaffold
- Commented source code for maintainability

## Tech stack
- HTML5 (semantic markup, OG/Twitter meta tags)
- CSS3 (custom properties, grid, flexbox, responsive media queries)
- JavaScript (vanilla ES2015+, no build step required)

    js/
      main.js

      (images live here)
  content.txt (optional consolidated copy)
```

## Getting started
- No build step required
- Option A: Open `index.html` directly in your browser
- Option B: Serve locally: `python3 -m http.server` â†’ visit http://localhost:8000

## Development guidance
- Edit copy directly in the page HTML files
- Global styles live in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Interactive behavior lives in `assets/js/main.js`
- Prefer semantic HTML for structure and accessibility
- Keep CSS organized by sections, using the existing comment headings

## Design system
Defined via CSS custom properties in `styles.css`:
- Colors: brand palette (blue variants), neutrals, and status colors
- Spacing scale: consistent spacing variables
- Typography scale: rem-based sizes with Inter font
- Radius & shadows: consistent elevation system
- Transitions: timing tokens for consistent, smooth UI

## Components & behavior
- Header & Navigation: sticky header, blurred background, keyboard-accessible mobile nav
- Hero: gradient overlay, responsive typography, primary/secondary CTA buttons
- Cards: accessible, animated hover states; responsive grid
- Forms: focus states with visible ring, loading states on submit, inline notification toasts
- Animations: `fade-in-up` via IntersectionObserver; reduced motion respected
- Lazy loading: observe images with `data-src` and swap into `src` when in view

## Accessibility
- High-contrast palette and focus outlines on inputs
- `aria-label`/`aria-expanded` used for mobile nav toggle
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support for reduced animations
- Clear heading hierarchy; constrained line length for readability

## Performance
- Preconnect and DNS-prefetch for Google Fonts
- Minimal JS; no frameworks/build step
- Lazy loading for images (opt-in via `data-src`)
- Subtle animations with GPU-friendly transforms

## SEO & social sharing
- Document titles and descriptions per page
- Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata in `index.html`
- Use descriptive alt text for images

## Analytics placeholder
`index.html` includes a minimal performance logging example. Replace the console logging with your analytics provider (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible) if desired.

## Images & media
- Place images in `assets/img/`
- For lazy loading, set `src` to a tiny placeholder (or omit) and set the real path on `data-src`. The script will populate `src` when the image enters the viewport.

### Responsive images (example)
In `services.html`, cards use `<picture>` with `srcset`/`sizes` to deliver appropriate resolutions:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="assets/img/leak-640.jpg 640w, assets/img/leak-960.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw">
  <img class="responsive-img" src="assets/img/leak-640.jpg" alt="Leak detection equipment in use">
  </picture>
```

## Change tracking (future-proof process)
To keep this documentation evergreen and make future updates easy to follow, use the following lightweight workflow:

1) Commit message style (Conventional Commits)
- `feat: ...` for new features
- `fix: ...` for bug fixes
- `docs: ...` for documentation-only changes
- `style: ...` for code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor: ...` for code refactors (no functional change)
- `perf: ...` for performance improvements
- `chore: ...` for maintenance tasks

2) Changelog management
- Keep the Changelog section below up to date for each meaningful change
- Use a new dated entry for grouped changes

3) What to record
- A short summary of what changed
- Affected files (or areas)
- Notable developer notes (migration steps, breaking changes, etc.)

4) Release tags (optional)
- Optionally tag milestones in git: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.
